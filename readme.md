# Matrices_with_simple_Neuralnet

You can use this to train a simple multi-layered neural network with back-propagation of error.

#Credits
to Phillipp Schuster for making most of the matrices java programm
I changed int -> double, Matrices start with 0,0 instead of 1,1.
Further more I added some helper functions for the neural network.
